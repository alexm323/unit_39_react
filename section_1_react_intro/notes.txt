React JS 
________________________________________
Students are always interested about react , without fail all of the instructors teach react 

it is one of those topics that everyone thinks they must learn it
it is a really good idea to know 

we are going to be learning react for a while 

we will start with a high level overview 

understand what React really is 

Get started with React components 

Front End Frameworks 
What are these? 

we have been working with backend frameworks thus far that make it easier for us to create a server and an application 
you don't have to use a framework ever but it can be a pain without it 

there is a gradient from express to something like sails 

there is a scale of complexity for the backend and it does also for the front end 

it helps us create front ends easily 

back in the day most of the applications were on a server somewhere and html and css was sent to you 
javascript improved and we ended up with js applications 

websites in the browser have become way more complicated and the amount of javascript we write are way more complicated

something like the netflix home page , that has all the images and can load videos and you can scroll through the categories 
how do you make this kind of thing? 

even with just regular js it would be a nightmare 

front end frameworks offer a blueprint 
their goal is to make development faster and less painful 

larger JS libraries (a framework is not just a collection of methods like axios,lodash, etc)

even something like flask and express expect a certain struture of folders to work correctly

often provide for code reuse 
prvide templating of HTML (like ejs,erb,jinja)

front end frameworks didnt really exist until we started writing a ton of javascript 

there are dozens of them 

angular , ember, vue, react
